# Contributing to ankra-cloud-csi

Thank you for helping improve the Ankra Cloud CSI driver. Bug reports, fixes and documentation improvements are all welcome.

## Reporting a problem

Open an issue with the chart and image version (`helm list -n kube-system`), the Kubernetes version and distribution,
what you expected, what happened, and the relevant logs (`kubectl -n kube-system logs <pod> -c <container>`). Remove
API tokens and other credentials before you paste anything.

Security problems are not reported in issues: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Making a change

1. Fork the repository and branch from `main`.
2. Make the change with a test. Go identifiers use full words (`requestError`, not `err`), except the idiomatic
   `ctx`, method receivers and `ok`.
3. Run the gates the pipeline runs:

   ```bash
   make vet test
   make lint        # golangci-lint v2
   make helm-lint   # when you touched the chart; run `make manifests` to re-render deploy/
   ```

4. Add a line under `Unreleased` in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for anything a user would notice.
5. Open a pull request against `main`. CI runs on Ankra Pipelines and reports one `Ankra pipeline` check.

The API client in `internal/ankraapi` is generated. Do not edit `operations_gen.go` by hand: run `make sync-client`
to regenerate it from the published Ankra Cloud OpenAPI document.

## Releases

Maintainers release by moving the `Unreleased` entries in CHANGELOG.md under the new version and setting `version` and
`appVersion` in the chart, in a pull request. Merging it is the release: the pipeline's run on main sees an
`appVersion` the registry does not have, publishes the image as `v<semver>` and pushes the chart to
`oci://share.ankra.cloud/charts`. Nobody pushes a tag, and a run that is repeated publishes nothing twice. The Helm
repository is updated by a pull request to [ankraio/ankra-charts](https://github.com/ankraio/ankra-charts).
